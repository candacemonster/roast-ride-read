# roast. ride. read.

a personal field guide by candace â€” for logging coffee worth repeating, trails worth returning to, and books worth carrying.

this site is built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme.

## what's here

- slow notes from outdoor days (gravel, hikes, paddleboard)
- reflections on resistance, solitude, and movement
- indie bookstore finds and reading logs
- coffee gear experiments and roaster shoutouts

## local setup

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
