  field note from the season that wandered off, and left me by the glow of my screen.

**location**: inside, mostly. actual trail: rare. 
**conditions**: dusk sneaking in earlier. grass gold, bikes colder.

i blinked and the equinox was here.
no warning, just daylight rationing like someone at the power company decided to cut me off.

summer? i heard rumors. apparently it happened.

what did i do?
worked.
watched my bikes and paddle board wait, gathering dust—no love, just guilt.
my computer got all my best hours. i’m cultivating a decent monitor tan.

the dogs and my husband:
a few walks.
a handful of sunsets.
three bonfires, if i’m padding the stats.

most weeks it was “just one more thing” on the screen, instead of “just one more trail.”
not proud. not dramatic. just wishing i’d chosen laces over logins, sweat over spreadsheets.

i’m not getting younger. these dogs, these mountains—deserve more than cameo appearances.
but at least we made it up to mackay, chasing sparks and dusk.
could’ve been weekly. was barely a season.

here’s to autumn:
maybe more memory, less inbox.
less digital daylight, more dog daylight.

for the trails.
for the ones waiting at the door.
