  our last desert walk together—a gentle, bittersweet field note about endings and small discoveries.

**location**: high point trail, red cliffs desert reserve, st. george, utah  
**conditions**: off cottonwood springs rd / old dump rd (black gulch trailhead)

we’d checked out a few trails the morning of October 25th. nothing urgent, just wandering, letting the girls stretch their legs—meant to be a quick scope at the trailhead, you know, just see what’s what. maybe come back for a longer hike or bike ride when joints and attitudes felt up for it.

old age and spinal arthritis had other plans. slapped us in the face, hard and fast, a few days later. plans for “next time” evaporated. and suddenly we were left saying goodbye, forever, to our baby and trail partner tove. desert light has felt a bit different after that.

## highlights (aka distractions for sore hearts)

## terrain notes

sandy, rocky, flat-ish. not much elevation gain, but every bump counts when the pack gets older. dog approval ratings fine for our gals, except for the holes (existential and otherwise).

## for fellow wanderers

bring water. stay humble. desert trails don’t care about your backstory.  
if you’re here with old dogs, take extra photos.  
leave no trace but maybe a few quiet memories.

sometimes the last hike looks like an ordinary morning. desert, dogs, your favorite person, just stretching out. nobody tells you this is the memory you’ll replay—and nobody warns you how sharp it turns if you blink.
