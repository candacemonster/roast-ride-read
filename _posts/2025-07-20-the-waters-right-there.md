  the board’s ready. i’m not. a short note from the shore.

**location**: reservoir edge, parked with a water view and no real excuse  
**conditions**: still. warm. strangers present but minding their business.

bought <a href="https://share-backcountry.onxmaps.com/exwods8oaVb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">onx backcountry</a>.  
not for the trails (though it does those), but for property lines. water access. land boundaries.  
also: to track paddles. to feel like i’m collecting something useful — or at least map-shaped.

everything’s ready:  
* board, inflated  
* gear, packed  
* water, calm  
* day, open  

still haven’t gone.

not scared. just stalled. that familiar static of having to walk past a few people, alone.  
then to be out there, still alone. even if i like it.

if there were a dock, i'd already be gone.  
if someone said *let’s go*, i would’ve.

instead, i stayed put.  
wrote this instead.  
maybe tomorrow.
