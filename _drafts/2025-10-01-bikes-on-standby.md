field notes on two loyal bikes, a questionable seat, and plans for more trail miles.

**location**: somewhere between winter plans and past excuses
**conditions**: bikes dusty, trails calling, seat tolerance low

i own two bikes. one i love so much it’s borderline unhealthy (the felt fatty dd70), and one i mostly like, except for the seat, which seems vengeful.

the fatty:
best bike ever. climbs like it’s got somewhere to be. embarrassingly fun on snow, sand, gravel, roots, rocks — possibly mud, haven’t tested, but i believe. worth every hour i should have spent riding it instead of forgetting it in the garage.

the timberjack:
solid. willing. but the seat... let’s just say, i understand why people invent alternative transportation. still, it gets me and the dogs out there, so it can’t be all bad.

*my salsa: a spicy red timberjack*

dogs love both bikes. they don’t care about models, just miles.

main confession:
i’m not an expert rider. i wear a helmet, not a uniform. i know enough to brake early and wish for wider tires when skepticism hits. mostly, i just enjoy it — and wish i’d hit it more.

heading south for the winter soon. new trails, desert air, less guesswork about where my gear lives.
with luck (and a better seat?), this season means fewer plans and more pedaling. the dogs are already plotting, and honestly, so am i.

for the miles i’ve missed, and the ones coming up.
for the bikes that wait, patiently, regardless.
