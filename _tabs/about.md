# roast. ride. read.

a personal field guide.  
written for me — but you’re welcome to eavesdrop.

it’s how i keep track of what felt worth recording:  
a cup of coffee worth repeating.  
a trail i’d return to.  
a book that made the world tilt, even slightly.

no tips. no hacks. no polished takeaways.  
just a log — of movement, stillness, and the quiet parts in between.

authored by candace —  
quiet on purpose, overpacked with books, and forever loyal to dogs and coffee.

## currently

**reading**  
whatever book isn’t already dog-eared beyond repair.  
current title: _[insert title here]_ (spoilers: probably not life-changing).

**listening**  
playlists that guarantee suitable background for navel-gazing.  
go ahead, judge my taste:  
[digital mixtapes](https://music.apple.com/profile/roastrideread)

**creating**  
writing, journaling, and sporadic attempts at something resembling art.  
expectations remain low, results variable.
