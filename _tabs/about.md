**roast. ride. read.** is a field guide.  
written for me — but you’re welcome to eavesdrop.

it’s how i keep track of what felt worth recording:  
a cup of coffee worth repeating.  
a trail i’d return to.  
a book that made the world tilt, even slightly.

no tips. no hacks. no polished takeaways.  
just a log — of movement, stillness, and the quiet parts in between.

authored by candace —  
quiet on purpose, overpacked with books, and forever loyal to dogs and coffee.
