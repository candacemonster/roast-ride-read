# roast. ride. read.

a personal field guide.  
written for me — you’re welcome to lurk.

this is where i log whatever felt worth remembering:  
a cup of coffee i’d knowingly risk heartburn for,  
a trail that didn’t require therapy after,  
a book that managed to rattle my existential snowglobe.

no tips, no hacks, definitely no “life-changing journeys.”  
just movement, stillness, and the quiet snark in between.

## currently

**reading**  
undecided—open to suggestions, unless it’s “life-changing.” mostly journaling; shuffling through morning and evening walks (rain + cold = character building).  
current title: 

**sipping**  
recently picked up some Pink Elephant coffee out of Park City, Utah. would recommend, but let’s not pretend it’s a spiritual awakening.

**listening**  
existential background noise and the occasional playlist for advanced navel-gazing.  
public taste, private judgments:

**creating**  
writing, journaling, and the occasional creative experiment.  
expectations are realistic; outcomes surprise even me.
